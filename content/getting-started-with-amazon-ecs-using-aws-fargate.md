## Getting Started with Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate

In this module we'll create our first Amazon ECS **cluster**, define a **task
definition** and a **container definition**, and deploy a **service** onto the
cluster from these definitions..

| Object | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cluster | Logical grouping of tasks and services. Infrastructure may be shared between tasks and services running on the same cluster. |
| Task Definition | Blueprint for our application. Defines attributes such as CPU and memory requirements, networking configuration, and container definitions. |
| Container Definition | Configuration for a container to run as part of our task. Defines attributes of the container including port mappings, resources requirements, environment variables, etc. |
| Service | Maintains a specified number of running simultaneous instances of a task definition in an ECS cluster |

We'll deploy our service via Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate as the launch type.
The Fargate launch type allows us to run our containerized applications
without the need to provision and manage the backend infrastructure. Amazon ECS
also can launch tasks and services using the EC2 launch type which runs
containerized applications on Amazon EC2 instances that we manage. Amazon ECS
is the orchestration service responsible for running docker containers and AWS
Fargate is the underlying compute platform where the containers will run.

### Implementation

Using the [Amazon ECS first run wizard][first-run], create an ECS cluster,
define a new task definition for a Hello World application, and deploy it as a
service onto the new cluster.

**‚úÖ Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click **Services** then select **Elastic
   Container Service** under Compute. If you've never used the service before,
   you'll see a **Getting started** button which will take you to the first run
   wizard. If you do not see this button, [navigate to the wizard
   directly][first-run].

1. The first page of the wizard outlines configuration details to build our new
   task definition. We're going to leave the defaults, but read through them to
   see what's being configured. It will define a new task definition with a
   container definition for **sample-app** which is a container running Apache
   httpd with a splash page. Note that the task will run using the **FARGATE**
   launch type and it is configured for **0.5GB of RAM** and **1/4th of a
   vCPU**. Click **Next**.

1. The next page outlines configuration details for our service. By default it
   will create an app called **simple-app-service** running a single task in a
   new security group. Note we can optionally create a load balancer here to
   distribute traffic across tasks in our service. We won't do this here but
   will later in the workshop. Leave the defaults and click **Next**.

1. The last page of the wizard allows us to name our cluster. Enter `workshop`
   into **Cluster name**. Click **Next**.

1. Review the details of the new task definition, service, and cluster on the
   next page and click **Create**.

1. The first run wizard will create the task definition, service, and cluster
   and all supporting infrastructure. It will show you its progress as it runs:

    Once complete, click **View service**.

1. Click on the **Tasks** tab to see the tasks running by the service. The task
   status will transition from **PROVISIONING** to **PENDING** to **RUNNING** as
   the task is placed within AWS Fargate, the container is pulled and started.
   Click the refresh button while the task starts.

1. Once started, click the ID of the task in the **Task** column. This will show
   you task details including networking configuration:

    Note the **Public IP** of the task.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the **Public IP** of the task. You'll see
   the Hello World splash page:

### ‚≠ê Recap

üîë The Fargate launch type allows us to run Docker containers without managing
the underlying instances. Amazon ECS is the orchestration system responsible
for running our containers using AWS Fargate.

üõ†Ô∏è We've created a new Amazon ECS cluster and deployed a service for the Hello
World application using the Fargate launch type onto that cluster.

### Next

‚úÖ  Proceed to the next module, [Create a Docker Image
Repository][create-docker-image-repo], wherein we'll create a new Docker image
repository using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
