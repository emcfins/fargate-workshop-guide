## Build and Push a Docker Image

This module walks the the process of building and pushing a Docker image of a
small web application for later deployment. A Docker image is a deployable
artifact that includes both application code and its dependencies. In this
module, we'll clone a repository from GitHub into our AWS Cloud9 workspace,
build a Docker image from it, test it, and push it to the Amazon ECR repository
created in the previous module.

The sample application is a simple web application for storing notable
quotations. It's written as a [node.js][node] application and uses the
[Express][express] web framework and the [AWS SDK][aws-sdk-js]. Quotations are
stored in a simple DynamoDB table called `quotes`.

The application has four endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PUT /quotes | Create a new quotation |
| GET /quotes/:quote_id | Show a specific quotation |
| GET /quotes | Show all quotations |
| GET / | Show status information |

### Implementation

#### 1. Build the Docker Image

Clone the sample application from the [GitHub repo][repo] and build it using a
tag of your repository from the repository URI you noted in the previous module.

**✅ Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.

1. Clone the contents of the sample application to your environment by running
   `git clone https://github.com/jpignata/fargate-workshop-app` in the Cloud9 terminal:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/jpignata/fargate-workshop-app
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment $ git clone https://github.com/jpignata/fargate-workshop-app
    Cloning into 'fargate-workshop-app'...
    remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    ```

1. The `fargate-workshop-app` directory will now appear in the environment
   explorer in the left-hand module. Expand it by clicking on it and open the
   files in the directory by double clicking on them.

1. Open the Dockerfile and inspect its contents. A [Dockerfile][dockerfile] is a text
   document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line
   to assemble an image.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:8.9.4             # Use node:8.9.4 as the base image

    WORKDIR /app                # Set the working directory for future commands

    EXPOSE 80                 # Indicates that our container will listen on TCP 80

    ADD index.js /app           # Add index.js and package.json to
    ADD package.json /app       #    the /app directory

    RUN npm install --silent    # Install dependencies into image

    CMD ["node", "index.js"]    # Set default command for containers run from
                                #    this image
    ```

1. In the Cloud9 terminal, change your working directory to the newly cloned
   application directory by running: `cd fargate-workshop-app`.

    ```console
    cd fargate-workshop-app
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

1. Build the Docker image and tag it using the repository URI you noted in the
   previous module. For example, if the repository URI were
   `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop`, then you'd run:

    ```console
    docker build --tag 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop .
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    Ensure that you change the image name to the repository URI you noted in the
    previous module. You'll see Docker building the image by applying each
    directive of the above Dockerfile in realtime:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ docker build --tag 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  59.39kB

    2f11c95c9552: Waiting
    ...
    ```

1. Verify that your Docker image has been built with the correct tag by running
   `docker images <repository URI>` in the Cloud9 terminal. For example:

    ```console
    docker images 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ docker images 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop
    REPOSITORY                                              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop   latest              7fca0f295425        35 seconds ago      714MB
    ```

#### 2. Create the DynamoDB Table

Create a DynamoDB table called `quotes` that has a primary key called `ID` which
is a string.

**✅ Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click **Services** then select **DynamoDB**
   under Database.

1. Click **Create table**.

1. Enter `quotes` in **Table name** and `ID` in **Primary Key**. Leave the data
   type dropdown set to **String**. Leave **Use default settings** checked.

    ![](images/build-dynamodb-table-create.png)

1. Click **Create**.

#### 3. Test the Docker Image

Run a Docker container in your Cloud9 environment and experiment with it using
`curl` and `jq` to verify it is working.

**✅ Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.

1. Install `jq` for JSON pretty printing.

    To aid in our testing, install `jq` which is a command line JSON processor.
    Install it by running `sudo yum install -y jq` in the Cloud9 terminal.

    ```console
    sudo yum install -y jq
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

1. Run the Docker container by running  `docker run` in the Cloud9 terminal
   using the Docker image we built in step 1:

    ```console
    docker run --detach --publish 80:80 --volume $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws \
      123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    You'll need to change the last parameter to the Docker image tag you
    specified in step 1. Let's look at each part of the command to understand
    what it is doing:

    | Argument | Description |
    | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | --publish 80:80 | Expose the container port 80 on the host. This will allow us to connect to 127.0.0.1:80 and that traffic will be forwarded to our application running in the container. |
    | --volume $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws | Mount our AWS configuration onto the container. This gives our application access to our AWS credentials for use in testing. |
    | --detach | Run the container in the background to allow us to use the terminal to run other commands. |
    | 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop | The docker image to run. Replace this parameter with the tag you used in step 1. |

1. Test the application using `curl`:

    ```console
    curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/ | jq
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    If the application is running, you'll see a JSON object with the hostname
    which will match the container ID you saw after running the previous step:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/ | jq
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "Hostname": "7826aae1b21e"
    }
    ```

1. Next, hit the quotes index endpoint to list all quotes in the database.

    ```console
    curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/quotes | jq
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    As we haven't added any quotes yet, we'll see an empty array:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/quotes | jq
    ```
    ```json
    []
    ```

1. Add a quote to the database:

    ```console
    curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/quotes -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Text":"There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.","AttributedTo":"Marshall McLuhan"}'
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    This command sends the following JSON object to the quotes create endpoint:

    ```json
    {
      "Text": "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.",
      "AttributedTo": "Marshall McLuhan"
    }
    ```

1. Hit the quotes index endpoint to list all quotes in the database to verify
   the quote has been added:

    ```console
    curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/quotes | jq
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    The output will resemble this, with a different UUID:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ curl -Ss http://127.0.0.1/quotes | jq
    ```
    ```json
    [
      {
        "ID": "3d1b9e30-f2fc-11e7-8bd2-99431fe07864",
        "AttributedTo": "Marshall McLuhan",
        "Text": "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew."
      }
    ]
    ```

#### 4. Push the Docker Image

Log into your Amazon ECR registry and push the Docker image into its repository.

**✅ Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Switch to the tab where you have your Cloud9 environment opened.

1. Log into your Amazon ECR registry using the helper provided by the AWS CLI
   in the Cloud9 terminal:

    ```console
    $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email)
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email)
    Login Succeeded
    ```

1. Push your Docker image. Ensure you change the image to the image tag you used
   in step 1:

    ```console
    docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop
    ```
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary copy">Copy to Clipboard</button>

    You'll see the Docker image being pushed:

    ```console
    Admin:~/environment/fargate-workshop-app (master) $ docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop
    The push refers to a repository [123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workshop]

### ⭐ Recap

🔑 Docker images are deployable artifacts that include both application code and
its dependencies bundled.

🛠️ You built a sample application with four simple REST endpoint and
pushed it to the Amazon ECR repository created in [Create a Docker Image
Repository](#create-a-docker-image-repository).

🛠️ You created a DynamoDB table named `quotes` to store data for our sample
application.

### Next

✅  Proceed to the next module, [Create a Service][create-a-service], wherein we
will configure a task definition and its IAM role, create a load balancer, and
create a new ECS service for this Docker container
